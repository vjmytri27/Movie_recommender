A movie recommender, often referred to as a movie recommendation system or movie recommendation engine, is software or an algorithm that proposes movies to users based on their tastes, viewing habits, or other relevant variables. A movie recommender's main objective is to make it simpler for consumers to find films they might like by offering them personalised movie ideas. Streaming services like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and Hulu, as well as movie review websites and mobile apps, all use movie recommenders extensively. Collaborative filtering algorithm is used here. Personalised recommendations are provided by recommendation systems using the common technique known as collaborative filtering, which takes advantage of user preferences and behaviour. It operates under the presumption that users who have previously agreed on a subject usually do so again on related subjects. Collaborative filtering takes into account how users have rated or interacted with films while suggesting new ones in the context of movie recommendations. 

Collaborative filtering mostly comes in two flavours:

1. User-Based Collaborative Filtering : This technique locates people who are comparable to the target user and generates recommendations based on their interests. User-based collaborative filtering involves the following steps: Using the target user's past movie ratings or interactions, determine how similar they are to other users. Cosine similarity and Pearson correlation are two popular metrics for similarity. Choose a group of users that most resembles the target user. Send the target user recommendations for films that users who share their interests.
   
2. Item-Based Collaborative Filtering : In this method, suggestions are generated by looking for films that the target user has already seen or engaged with. The following are the steps for item-based collaborative filtering: Using user feedback or interactions, determine how similar each pair of films is. Choose the films that the target user has rated or with which they have interacted. Send suggestions for films that are comparable to those the user has already enjoyed.
